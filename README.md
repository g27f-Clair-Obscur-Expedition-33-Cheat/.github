## 🎮 What Is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33?

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 throws you into a surreal world where art meets apocalypse. Every year, a mysterious entity called The Paintress wipes out humanity one number at a time. This time, it’s "33" on the chopping block. You play as Gustave and his squad, fighting to break the cycle using a turn-based combat system that feels part Souls-like, part shooter, and all chaos.

Now imagine all that – but with infinite health, max resources, and one-shot kills 😈
